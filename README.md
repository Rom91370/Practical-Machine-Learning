# Practical-Machine-Learning

This project is an excercise from Coursera about Machine Learning.

Data collected from accelerometers is used to know more about how users are doing the excercice.
The main purpose of the project is to define a good model (see on machine learning class) to predict on a testing dataset if the data corresponding to a good excercice (class A) or not.
